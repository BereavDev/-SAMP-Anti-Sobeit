# -SAMP-Anti-Sobeit
This code is purely excerpt, and not mine. I'm just sharing it here for it to be found on my github profile and for other people to access.

This anti sobeit is quotation from russian forum. I tested with Johnny Project and didn't come across any errors but the result of anti sobeit is never certain. These codes scan the d3d9.dll and may detect it as sobeit for enb modes.
